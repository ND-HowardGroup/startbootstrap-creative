                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Traditional techniques like confocal fluorescence microscopy use ultraviolet or visible light for excitation which causes high scattering in the living tissue and results in low penetration and poor signal-to-noise ratio. These problems can be avoided by utilizing advanced nonlinear optical methods such as two-photon microscopy. The benefits of nonlinear optics based imaging modalities stem from the two facts: (a) the use of near infrared light for excitation, which scatters significantly less in the living tissue, provides for deeper penetration and higher signal-to-noise ratio and (b) two-photon induced luminescence is extremely localized which enables 3D imaging without requiring a pinhole and provides for a much better photon economy.<p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">While advances in two-photon microscopy technology allow for faster and deeper imaging in vivo, quantitative chemical imaging still remains challenging. There exists only a few probes that show sensitivity to biologically relevant chemical species such as dissolved oxygen. An even fewer of them are water-soluble which makes high-resolution quantitative oxygen imaging in vivo difficult and expensive. In the search of hydrophilic dyes that are sensitive to dissolved oxygen, several techniques have been developed, such as attaching hydrophilic dendrimers and immobilizing the dye in a polymer matrix.</p>

<p class="text-muted">Our work presents another technique to prepare hydrophobic dyes for aqueous media applications. We achieve this by encapsulating an oxygen-sensitive hydrophobic dye, RuDpp3 {Tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) dichloride} in a surfactant, poloxamer 407.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is important for fluorescence lifetime imaging, especially for multiphoton excitation, which generally has weaker fluorescence intensity than the traditional one-photon confocal excitation.</p>
                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">During fluorescence lifetime imaging, very few photons are detected per pixel; therefore the signal quality is usually limited by the photon quantum noise. This problem is more severe for the multiphoton excitation fluorescence, since multiphoton processes result in lower fluorescence intensity than single-photon excitation. This research is aiming at finding ways to improve the SNR in the lifetime acquisition method.<p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">To quantify and evaluate the SNR performance of the multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging method, two figure-of-merits are used in this research: the photon economy (F-value), and the normalized SNR. F-value quantifies the sensitivity of the lifetime acquisition approach. It is always larger than 1, and the closer the value to 1, the better the SNR performance. While the normalized SNR is positvely correlated with the performance. SNR depends on both the waveform of the modulated light on the detector side, and the lock-in technique used on the detector side. Theoretical analysis, mainly the error propagation method, and Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to quantify the figure-of-merits for a variety of modulation waveforms (source side) and lock-in techniques (detector side) respectively.</p>

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common genetic blood disorder, can cause a number of health complications including chronic pain, anemia, chronic infection and stroke. It is caused by a single point mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution in the oxygen transport molecule hemoglobin (Hb) which, upon deoxygenation, polymerizes into rigid fibers deforming red blood cells. These deformed, or sickled, red blood cells (RBC) have shortened circulation life, differing surface properties from oxygenated RBCs, are mechanically inflexible, and can cause clotting. Reliable DNA and biochemical assays are routinely performed for initial detection of the sickle cell trait and to quantify the severity of anemia. However, there is variation among the seriousness of symptoms and frequency of crisis states which are not well understood. Further, links between SCD and immune system dysfunction have been demonstrated leaving many unanswered questions about the mechanism and extent of immune dysregulation. It is of value to develop methods that allow for in vivo monitoring of the disease progression. This study proposes the monitoring of a number of intrinsic and optically detectable disease markers which may lead to useful methodologies for gaining insight into the physical factors responsible for symptoms of SCD.<p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">We have proposed and have demonstrated ex vivo MPM imaging and identify endogenous distinctions between healthy and SCD tissue. These features can be mapped to physiological conditions and used to image the system over the course of disease progression to study the impact on the immune system. Further, it is proposed that a second harmonic signal can be generated from the sickle cell variant of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which has been shown to possess the required non-centrosymmetry for a non-zero, second order electric susceptibility tensor. The Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) could potentially be used to study sickled RBC circulation, especially in sensitive vasculature, e.g. brain where MPM related imaging has been successfully demonstrated elsewhere. The intrinsic Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence (TPEF) studied here is largely attributed to cellular NADH, characteristically blue-green (i.e. 460-520 nm), as well as Porphyrins and Lipofuscins, which are found in higher concentrations in cellular repair and inflammation machinery such as leukocytes and emit at longer wavelengths, (i.e. 500-660 nm).</p>
